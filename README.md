Project66: You are hired as a network engineer for Buzz Infotech, a midsized enterprise with a 5-floor office building. Each floor is equipped with a
different number of computers, like floor 1 has 2223, floor 2 has 236, floor
3 has 23412, floor 4 has 334, and floor 5 has 1111. Configure the HTTP
server on floor 1, the DNS server should be connected on floor 3, the Email
server should be connected on floor 2, and the FTP and DHCP servers of the
company are on floor 5. The organization requires a well-structured network to
ensure efficient communication and scalability.
Network Design Requirements:
1. Topology Selection: Design a Mesh topology for the first 2 floors and a Bus
topology for the remaining floors, considering performance and fault tolerance.
(Just connect 7 computers on each floor instead of the given requirement, as we
are not able to do this in Cisco Packet Tracer.)
2. IP Addressing Scheme: The company has decided to use Class A public
IPv4 addresses for the first 3 floors and Class B public for the remaining
floors, following a classless addressing scheme that is VLSM. Allocate IP
addresses properly for each floor, ensuring uniqueness.
3. Routing Strategy for Inter-Floor Communication & Connectivity:
Recommend a routing approach that is Static for inter-floor communication.
 Design how the floors will be connected for seamless interdepartment
communication.
 Suggest the appropriate network devices (e.g., switches, routers, access
points) and their placement.
 If using dynamic routing, use RIP routing protocol.
 If using static routing, define the static routes for efficient data flow.
 The minimum number of routers to be used should be 4 and the
maximum 5.
 Specify the number of default gateways along with IP addresses.
 Specify each SUBENTWORK with proper Subnetwork address, host IP
range, and broadcast address.
Report Writing: Write the project report, which includes all the above things along
with the labeled network scenario, and also mention the innovation done by you in the
project.
Then upload the project on GitHub as well as check the engagement level of the
project uploaded on GitHub.
